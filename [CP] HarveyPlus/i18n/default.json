	"Fall.Indoor_Night_3": "I'm due for an eye exam but I've been putting off scheduling one.#$b#They say doctors are the worst patients and I admit there's some truth to that.",
	"Fall.Indoor_Night_4": "It's funny to think about how I used to be scared of getting old.#$b#I think what I was really scared of was getting old alone. I'd love to grow old with you.$1",

	"Winter.Rainy_Night_0": "Do they make heated weighted blankets?#$e#If they don't, they should. There must be a market for that.",
